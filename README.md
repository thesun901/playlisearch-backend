# Playlisearch backend

This github repo is custom backend for ios app playlisearch (also could be found on my repository). It gathers information about spotify playlists and categorizes them according to **artists** spotify category and saves to database. Saved playlists (with top 6 categories) are being provided randomly on requests to api.
